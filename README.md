# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenge

[Hacker Rank 30 Day Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

30 Days of Code is an opportunity to learn how to code or brush up on your 
fundamentals. Each day at 9am, you will unlock a new challenge and a corresponding 
video tutorial to help you learn. The tutorial is Java-based, but you can choose 
other popular languages to submit your solution. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures and more.

## Day 0: Hello, World

Task:

Save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print "Hello, World." on a single line. 
Print the value of your variable on a second line. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

## Day 1: Data Types

Task:

* Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.

* Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.

* Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 

    * Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.

    * Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place 
    on a new line.

    * Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a 
    new line. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types)

## Day 2: Operators

Task:

Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators)

## Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements

Task:

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

* If  is odd, print Weird
* If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird.
* If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird.
* If  is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements)

## Day 4: Class vs. Instance

Task:

Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that 
takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign 
initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not 
negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should 
set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0. In addition, you must 
write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.

2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:

    * If age < 13, print You are young.

    * If age >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager.

    * Otherwise, print You are old. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-class-vs-instance)
