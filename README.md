# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenge

[Hacker Rank 30 Day Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

30 Days of Code is an opportunity to learn how to code or brush up on your 
fundamentals. Each day at 9am, you will unlock a new challenge and a corresponding 
video tutorial to help you learn. The tutorial is Java-based, but you can choose 
other popular languages to submit your solution. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures and more.

### Day 0: Hello, World

Task:

Save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print "Hello, World." on a single line. 
Print the value of your variable on a second line. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

### Day 1: Data Types

Task:

* Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.

* Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.

* Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 

    * Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.

    * Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place 
    on a new line.

    * Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a 
    new line. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types)

### Day 2: Operators

### Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements

Task:

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

* If  is odd, print Weird
* If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird.
* If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird.
* If  is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements)

### Day 4: Class vs. Instance

Task:

Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that 
takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign 
initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not 
negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should 
set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0. In addition, you must 
write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.

2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:

    * If age < 13, print You are young.

    * If age >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager.

    * Otherwise, print You are old. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-class-vs-instance)

### Day 5: Loops

Task:

Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i 
(where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.
[Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops)

### Day 6: Let's Review

Task:

Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N - 1, print its even-indexed 
and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line. 0 is 
considered to be an even index. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop)

### Day 7: Arrays

Task:

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single 
line of space-separated numbers. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays)

### Day 8: Phone a Friend

Task:

Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friendsâ€™ names to 
their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names 
to query your phone book for. For each name queried, print the associated entry from 
your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for name 
is not found, print Not found instead. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-phone-a-friend)

### Day 9: Recursion

Task:

Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N as a parameter and 
prints the result of N! (N factorial). [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion)

### Day 10: Binary Numbers

Task:

Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print 
the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary 
representation. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers)

### Day 11: 2D Arrays

Task:

Given a 6x6 2D Array, A:

```python
    1 1 1 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    1 1 1 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
```


We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling in this 
pattern in A's graphical representation:

```python
    a b c
      d
    e f g
```


There are 16 hourglasses in A, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

### Day 12: Inheritance

Task:

You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and 
Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student 
are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties 
of Person. Complete the Student class. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-inheritance)

### Day 13: Abstract Classes

Task:

Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

* Inherits from Book

* Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters:
    
    1. string title
    2. string author
    3. int price

* Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these  lines:
    1. Title:, a space, and then the current instance's title.
    2. Author:, a space, and then the current instance's author.
    3. Price:, a space, and then the current instance's price.

### Day 14: Scope

Task:

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

* A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it 
to the elements instance variable.

* A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between 
any 2 numbers in N and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable. 
[Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-scope)

### Day 15: Linked List

Task:

Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass 
data as the Node constructor argument) and inserts it at the tail of the linked 
list referenced by the head parameter. Once the new node is added, return the 
reference to the head node. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-linked-list)

### Day 16: Exceptions - String to Integer

Task:

Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to an 
integer, print Bad String. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-exceptions-string-to-integer)

### Day 17: More Exceptions

Task:

Write a Calculator class with a single method: int power(int,int). The power 
method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and returns the integer result 
of n**p. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception with 
the message: n and p should be non-negative. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-more-exceptions)

### Day 18: Queues and Stacks

Task:

To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in s, enqueue it in a 
queue, and also push that same character onto a stack. Once that's done, we must 
dequeue the first character from the queue and pop the top character off the stack, 
then compare the two characters to see if they are the same; as long as the characters 
match, we continue dequeueing, popping, and comparing each character until our 
containers are empty (a non-match means s isn't a palindrome).

Write the following declarations and implementations:

    1. Two instance variables: one for your stack, and one for your queue.

    2. A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
    
    3.A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the 
    queue instance variable.

    4. A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the 
    top of the stack instance variable.

    5. A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character 
    in the stack instance variable. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-queues-stacks)

### Day 19: Interfaces

Task:

The AdvancedArithmetic interface and the method declaration for the abstract int 
divisorSum(int n) method are provided for you in the editor below. Write the 
Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface. The 
implementation for the divisorSum method must be public and take an integer 
parameter, n, and return the sum of all its divisors. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-interfaces)

### Day 20: Sorting

Task:

Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

    1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps. 
    where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

    2. First Element: firstElement 
    where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.

    3. Last Element: lastElement 
    where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array. 

[Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-sorting)

### Day 21: Generics

Task:

Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function. [Try it!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-generics)
